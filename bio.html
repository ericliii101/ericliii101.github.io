            Hello! My name is Eric, I use he/him pronouns. I'm a second-year university student studying computer science at Northwestern's McCormick School of Engineering. <br> <br>
            
            My interests are in applying data modeling and neural networks to creative fields such as environment design and music. I'm intrigued in uncovering the patterns among
            seemingly abstract topics, be it human emotions, inspiration, or creativity. The process of breaking down high-level concepts into numerical chunks
            interests me just as much as building the pieces back up into something wonderful: a song, an artwork, or a story.<br><br>

            A little bit about my personal background: I grew up in Illinois, Hong Kong, and Shanghai. Illinois is where I currently call home. I love travelling and exploring
            diverse environments. Being somewhere new has always been great for letting ideas flow and setting new goals. <br><br>

            It's been surprising seeing the types of experiences studying computer science has offered in just three years. Learning new languages, building an app, a game, and
            now a website portfolio, and getting exposed to applications in fields from finance to neurobiology&mdash;I definitely found the diversity of immersive
            opportunities unexpected. As new things come along, I'll try to update this page to keep track.
