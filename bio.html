            Hello! My name is Eric, I use he/him pronouns. I'm a second-year university student studying computer science at Northwestern's McCormick School of Engineering. <br> <br>
            
            My interests are in applying data modeling and neural networks to creative fields such as art and music. I'm intrigued in uncovering the logic and patterns among
            seemingly abstract topics, be it human emotions, inspiration, or creativity. The process of breaking down concepts like those into numerical chunks
            interests me just as much as building the pieces back up into something wonderful: a song, an artwork, or a functioning brain.<br><br>

            A little bit about my personal background: I grew up in Illinois, Hong Kong, and Shanghai. Illinois is where I currently call home. I love travelling and exploring
            diverse environments. Being somewhere new has always been great for letting ideas flow, setting new goals, and discovering new hobbies. <br><br>

            It's been surprising how many experiences studying computer science has offered in just two years. Learning more and more languages, building an app, a game, and
            now a website with this portfolio, and getting exposed to computer science's significance in fields from finance to neurobiology... I definitely found it unexpected
            how the discipline offers immersion in so many areas so quickly. As new things come along, I'll try to update this page to keep track of them.
