                Sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy (SHE)
                is often misdiagnosed as other sleep disorders with similar yet non-epileptic motor events,
                hindering patients' ability to receive proper treatment. Our research aimed to develop an effective machine learning
                model to diagnose SHE based on electroencephalogram data during NREM sleep.
                The accuracy of our model indicates the value of machine learning algorithms in differentiating SHE from healthy sleeping patterns,
                while the ease of use provides insight into the feasibility of application in the clinical setting.

                            Sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy (SHE) is a rare sleep disorder characterized by brief hypermotor seizures during
                            the non-rapid eye movement (NREM) stages of sleep.
                            An electroencephalogram (EEG) measures electrical activity from the brain by placing electrodes
                            on specific parts of the scalp to record signals throughout sleep. Abnormalities in signal recordings during NREM stages
                            can indicate a sleep disorder, and EEG data is commonly utilized when diagnosing SHE. <br> <br>
                            To develop our model, we employed 53 publicly available polysomnographic EEG recordings through random-forest,
                            support-vector machine, and logistic regression learning algorithms. 70% of the EEG recordings were used to train while
                            30% was used to test. The model was trained on the extracted mean, minimum, maximum, standard deviation, and variance for the alpha, beta, theta, and delta waves
                            of each subject's EEG recording. <br> <br>
                            Results indicate the model&#39;s ability to distinguish between EEG recordings of healthy patients and those with SHE.
                            With a highest test accuracy of 81.3% in the random forest classifier, the model is not accurate enough to serve as an independent mode of SHE diagnosis.
                            Howerver, it holds potential as an additional resource to assist the highly difficult SHE diagnosis process.
                            Machine learning models of this type can support and expedite the manual process of EEG-based SHE diagnosis.

                HookUp, a tilt-based bicycle storage rack, reduces the physical strain involved in vertical bicycle storage while maximizing
                storage efficiency. Incorporating a mounted hook, upright stand, and wheel ramp, we designed HookUp to eliminate vertical lifting and require
                only the front half of a bicycle to be rotated. HookUp&#39;s freestanding structure provides vertical bicycle storage in areas previously not possible.
                Applied with our space optimization process, HookUp enables 10 additional bikes to be stored in 3440 N. Lake Shore Drive's recycling room alone.

                            Previously, bike owners at 3440 N. Lake Shore Drive could store their bikes either for a small fee at racks in the building&#39;s parking garage or for free
                            by hanging them on assigned hooks in two storage rooms. The buildings' condo association reached out to us to 1) increase the number of bikes that can be stored while
                            2) removing bikes from the parking garage to free up car parking, and 3) making it less physically taxing for residents to store their bikes.<br> <br>
                            
                            HookUp was designed to address each of these needs. We&#39;ve removed the need to lift bikes off the ground by mounting hooks on a free-standing wooden frame
                            at an angle that allows the owner to simply tilt their bike up on its back wheel and secure it to the stand. Adjacent bikes are stored by angling handlebars
                            in a way that allows pedals and handlebars to overlap, decreasing the footprint of each bike and allowing more bikes to be stored in a smaller amount of space. <br> <br>
                            
                            HookUp can be applied to the building&#39;s recycling room to open up 10 additional bike storage spots. Further, it is recommended that both of the building&#39;s dedicated bike storage
                            rooms have their vertical hanging hook system replaced with HookUp units to eliminate the physical strain induced by vertical lifting.
                            Through our proposed space optimization process, HookUp enables the condo association to move bikes out of the garage and free up more car parking spaces.

                Echo Trifecto, a three stage noise reduction process, is our stepwise approach for reducing echo-induced interference in Kranze Technology's workplace.
                Echo intensity is measured by reverberation time in either the waveform or spectrogram domain. Echo Trifecto's core instrumentation of a velour and mass loaded vinyl-based
                treatment balances minimizing reverb. times with maximizing cost-volume effectiveness. A stage-based implementation timeline enables Kranze Technology Solutions to meet
                initial budgetary goals while facilitating further expansion.

                            Employees at Kranze Technologies Solutions (KTS)'s warehouse on 1794 Winthrop Drive have experienced noise issues throughout
                            the large open workspace. KTS aims to find a solution that limits echoes from interfering with conversations
                            while staying within budgetary needs, maintaining workplace appearance, and preserving important safety systems. <br> <br>

                            Echo Trifecto was proposed as our escalating sound treatment procedure to maximally meet these goals. The three tiers of implementation
                            administer a threefold treatment of mass loaded vinyl (MLV), velour curtains, and industrial floor rugs at varying degrees. Testing of vinyl-based
                            barriors, acoustic fabrics, and floor and ceiling treatments established this combination as the most cost-effective in achieving the needed levels
                            of echo reduction. <br> <br>

                            Echo Trifecto's first two stages concentrate velour curtains and MLV implementation in areas with the greatest foot traffic
                            and conversation. The earliest stage best meets KTS' willingness to invest in echo reduction. Stages two and three expand sound treatment
                            coverage throughout the warehouse to minimize echo reverberation times. Echo Trifecto's stepwise procedure grants KTS the ability to
                            correspond their level of sound treatment investment with the improvements they see to their workplace noise environment.
