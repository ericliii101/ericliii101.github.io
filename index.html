                The use of machine learning models to detect and diagnose sleep disorders has grown in popularity,
                but research is sparse for sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy (SHE).
                SHE is often misdiagnosed as other sleep disorders with similar yet non-epileptic motor events,
                hindering patients' ability to receive proper treatment. Our research aimed to develop an effective machine learning
                model to diagnose SHE based on electroencephalogram data during NREM sleep.
                The accuracy of our model indicates the value of machine learning algorithms in differentiating SHE from healthy sleeping patterns,
                while the ease of use provides insight into the feasibility of application in the clinical setting.

                            Sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy (SHE) is a rare sleep disorder characterized by brief hypermotor seizures during
                            the non-rapid eye movement (NREM) stages of sleep.
                            An electroencephalogram (EEG) measures electrical activity from the brain by placing electrodes
                            on specific parts of the scalp to record signals throughout sleep. Abnormalities in signal recordings during NREM stages
                            can indicate a sleep disorder, and EEG data is commonly utilized when diagnosing SHE. <br> <br>
                            To develop our model, we employed 53 publicly available polysomnographic EEG recordings through random-forest,
                            support-vector machine, and logistic regression learning algorithms. 70% of the EEG recordings were used to train while
                            30% was used to test. The model was trained on the extracted mean, minimum, maximum, standard deviation, and variance for the alpha, beta, theta, and delta waves
                            of each subject's EEG recording. <br> <br>
                            Results indicate the model&#39;s ability to distinguish between EEG recordings of healthy patients and those with SHE.
                            With a highest test accuracy of 81.3% in the random forest classifier, the model is not accurate enough to serve as an independent mode of SHE diagnosis.
                            Howerver, it holds potential as an additional resource to assist the highly difficult SHE diagnosis process.
                            Machine learning models of this type can support and expedite the manual process of EEG-based SHE diagnosis.

                To reduce physical strain involved in vertical bicycle storage while maximizing bicycle storage capacity, my team and I designed HookUp, a tilt-based bicycle storage rack
                for 3440 N. Lake Shore Drive. Employing a mounted hook, freestanding stand, and floor ramp, HookUp eliminates vertical lifting and requires
                only the front half &nbsp; of a bike to be tilted. HookUp&#39;s freestanding structure provides vertical bike storage in areas previously not possible.
                One specific place is the recycling room where our space optimization proposal, which rearranges the room&#39;s recycling bins, 
                enables 10 additional bikes to be stored with the use of HookUp.
